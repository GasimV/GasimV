## About Me

I am a **Data Scientist | AI Architect & Engineer | Robotics & Mechatronics Engineer** focused on **designing intelligent systems using whatever technology the problem demands**.

I specialize in the **integration of AI, data-driven intelligence, and robotic systems**, combining software architecture, machine learning, and engineering disciplines to build **end-to-end intelligent solutions**—from perception and decision-making to control and real-world deployment.

I have strong expertise in **architecting AI-driven systems** using modern architectural practices, including **C4 Model–based system design**, **ADR-driven decision making**, and **architecture verification (ATAM)**. My work focuses on building **scalable, secure, and cost-efficient AI platforms**, particularly for **GenAI, RAG-based systems, and multi-agent architectures**, while maintaining high standards of quality, observability, and governance.

With a background in **Robotics & Mechatronics Engineering**, I bridge **AI software architecture with physical systems**, control logic, sensors, actuators, and hardware-aware constraints—enabling intelligent systems that operate reliably in real-world, dynamic environments.

## Professional Focus

I design **intelligent, production-grade systems** that combine **AI, robotics, and software architecture**—balancing performance, scalability, safety, cost, and long-term evolution. My focus is on systems that **think, decide, and act** in real-world conditions, whether purely digital or cyber-physical.
